Hello

This Website is just a page to share my links
The rolling image in the back is a result of a lot of CSS and time. 

This is also just a starting point, I will add much more to the page, including:
	-an About me landing page, that'll be added to the links (mainly HTML/CSS)
	-more JS functions(for an asteroid idea i had in mine)
	-more Sass, (i had to delete some because the functions were freezing the rolling image in the back)
	-more to the page in general	
	
There are also a few things to fix, like:
	-fix how website looks on phone and small windows (landscape is fine, portrait needs work)
	-try and fix the resize issue with the rolling photo (i may need help with this one)

Hope you like it
